# GitLab Classroom Application - Setup and Run Instructions

The **GitLab Classroom application** is a full-stack web tool developed as part of my thesis. It is designed to improve the management of classroom activities, assignments, and the assessment of student projects, labs, and tasks for teachers and professors of the Faculty of Electronics and Information Sciences at the Warsaw University of Technology.

By utilizing the powerful version control and project management functions of GitLab, along with the GitLab API, this application helps address the challenges of managing and evaluating assignments, providing timely feedback, and facilitating collaboration in programming projects.

## Prerequisites
